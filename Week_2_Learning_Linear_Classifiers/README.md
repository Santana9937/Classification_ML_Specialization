### Week 2 assignments for Coursera Machine Learning: Classification course from the University of Washington.

### Ipython notebook for Predicting sentiment from product reviews

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Santana9937/Classification_ML_Specialization/blob/master/Week_1_Predicting_Sentiment_from_Reviews/week_1_lin_classifier_assign.ipynb

In this notebook, you will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative.

* Use DataFrames to do some feature engineering
* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.
* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.
* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.
* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the **accuracy** of the model.
* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.
* Compare multiple logistic regression models.
