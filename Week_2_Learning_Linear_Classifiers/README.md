### Week 2 assignments for Coursera Machine Learning: Classification course from the University of Washington.

### Ipython notebook for Implementing logistic regression from scratch

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Santana9937/Classification_ML_Specialization/blob/master/Week_2_Learning_Linear_Classifiers/week_2_assign_1_lin_class_scratch.ipynb

In this notebook, you will implement your own logistic regression classifier. You will:

 * Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
 * Implement the link function for logistic regression.
 * Write a function to compute the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to a single coefficient.
 * Implement gradient ascent.
 * Given a set of coefficients, predict sentiments.
 * Compute classification accuracy for the logistic regression model.

### Ipython notebook for Logistic Regression with L2 regularization

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Santana9937/Classification_ML_Specialization/blob/master/Week_2_Learning_Linear_Classifiers/week_2_assign_2_lin_reg_L2_reg.ipynb

In this notebook, you will implement your own logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization. You will do the following:

 * Extract features from Amazon product reviews.
 * Write a function to compute the derivative of log likelihood function with an L2 penalty with respect to a single coefficient.
 * Implement gradient ascent with an L2 penalty.
 * Empirically explore how the L2 penalty can ameliorate overfitting.
