### Week 2 assignments for Coursera Machine Learning: Classification course from the University of Washington.

### Ipython notebook for Predicting sentiment from product reviews

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Santana9937/Classification_ML_Specialization/blob/master/Week_1_Predicting_Sentiment_from_Reviews/week_1_lin_classifier_assign.ipynb

In this notebook, we will use data on house sales in King County, Seatle to predict prices using multiple regression. The goal of this notebook is to explore multiple regression and feature engineering. You will:

* Use DataFrames to do some feature engineering
* Use sklearn to compute the regression weights (coefficients/parameters)
* Given the regression weights, predictors and outcome write a function to compute the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)
* Look at coefficients and interpret their meanings
* Evaluate multiple models via RSS
